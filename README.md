# Queue length estimation with AI methods
- Create a queueing model at signalized intersections (e.g. shockwave profile model)
- Create a simple SUMO network with traffic lights
- Create logs of vehicle trajectories or queue lengths
- With a machine learning based technique estimate the parameters of the said queueing model
- Validate the results with SUMO
